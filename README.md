Wow, back here again. Just using this for any notes that don't fit into other repositories.

Hello everyone, 
My name is Margo or MargoMundo. A cyborg who splits her time making art and working with computers. 
I love sushi and tacos as well as traveling!~ I don't like bugs(the living and non-living ones) or having a low battery. 
Pleased to meet you all.
